KNOWN BUGS
----------

dumpelf -vvvv ; This can segv on some malformed ELF files when trying to 
print *data;

when using scanelf -ln and the /etc/ld.so.conf includes file which 
includes the orig /etc/ld.so.conf again will cause a recursion segv.
This is not really a problem however as any system containing such a
malformed ld.so.conf would have bigger problems.
